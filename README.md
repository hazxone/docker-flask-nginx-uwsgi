# Docker container for Flask, Nginx, and uWSGI, + Letsencrypt's certbot-auto for HTTPS

## Purpose:
Provide Dockerfile and all applicable config and base Flask scripts necessary to start a webpage, with a script to automate HTTPS re-configuration.

## Why do I use it?:

With this container and a built image (or pulling the image from ucnt/flaskwebpage), <b>you can get an HTTP or HTTPS server setup in 2 commands</b>:
- sudo docker build -t flaskwebpage .<br>
THEN<br>
- HTTP: sudo docker run -dit -p 80:80 --restart=always --name flaskwebpage flaskwebpage <br>
  OR
- HTTPS (change parameters): sudo docker run -dit -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --restart=always --name flaskwebpage flaskwebpage "-d example.com,www.example.com -n example.com -e my@email.com"

## Notes/Details:
- <b>Be sure docker is installed.  If not installed, run install_docker.sh</b>
- You can access the container via: sudo docker exec -i -t flaskwebpage /bin/bash
- Folder/File Sctructure:
    - Current
        - All of the files+folders in this repo will be, by default, put into /home/flask.  
        - The /home/flask/app folder will contain the Flask app.  You can swap in and out any flask app that you want (so long as you have the necessary libraries installed).
    - Optional method
        - You can add a parameter to the RUN command to mount a local volumne to a directory in the container.  Benefit is this allows you to edit the files without having to go into the container.
        - Example additional parameter: -v /home/user/flask/app:/home/flask/app
- This script uses linux's Supervisor to monitor and control uWSGI and nginx.
- Port 443 is left on the run command in case you want to use it.  If you never will, you can remove "-p 443:443"


## HTTPS Setup Options (assumes 1 domain per container instance)
  
### Easy way: 

Put the domain info in the docker run command: 

sudo docker run -dit -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --restart=always --name flaskwebpage flaskwebpage "-d example.com,www.example.com -n example.com -e my@email.com"

### Semi-easy way: 

Run the docker container for 443 as well as 80 then run the automated setup script after the container is up:

sudo docker run -dit -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --restart=always --name flaskwebpage flaskwebpage

/home/flask/conf/setup-https.py -d example.com,www.example.com -n example.com -e my@email.com

### HARD way: 

Run: /home/flask/certbot-auto certonly -d [YOURDOMAIN] -w /home/flask/app<br>
OR <br>
Copy your existing certs to the folder of your choice.  THEN...

  - Adjust /home/flask/conf/nginx-https-template.conf to use HTTPS by replacing YOURDOMAIN with the domain you are setting up and, if you copied a cert into a folder, change the directory from /etc/letsencrpyt/live
      
  - Remove /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx-http.conf
      
  - Re-link ntinx-https.conf to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled: ln -s /home/flask/conf/nginx-https-template.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginx-http.conf
      
  - Restart the supervisor service
